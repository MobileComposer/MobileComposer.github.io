 Last March I was eating lunch at the University of St. Thomas campus in downtown Minneapolis and ran into a friend who worked at the Minnesota High Tech Association (MHTA). He told me about a program MHTA started called SciTechsperience, this program matched STEM interns with internships at small to medium sized companies. At the time I had been looking for internships but I knew I didn't want to work at a large company so this opportunity was perfect for me. 

Fast forward a couple months and it is June of 2016, I had just started the internship program at Mobile Composer as a Web Developer Intern and was excited to learn and grow my skills. The biggest factor in choosing to work for Mobile Composer for me was the size of the company, their product,and the team I would work with. I wanted to work for a company that would allow me to do many things and grow skills in different areas, which working for a start-up allows you to do. Before I started I had experience in Java, C, and JavaScript. The learning curve for me came with all the technologies that were used in our stack and how they intertwined with each other. To combat this we were assigned to go through course on Plural Sight and this helped a lot. I learn by doing the problems and going through material so the tutorials through the site really helped that learning curve. The intern group was a group of four and we all had different programming backgrounds which was great. One of the main takeaways I learned is how to work with a team to solve problems. Our team had weekly deliverables and that gave us a guideline of what we should be getting done at the end of the week. As we progressed through the summer our deliverables got bigger, this was the result of us getting more done throughout the week as we got more comfortable with the technologies we were using. During an internship some advice I would give is to try and learn as much as you can. As a developer you are always learning new things, so donâ€™t waste an opportunity to gain as much knowledge as possible that will help you develop your skills.  

This internship would end up being the last one I take during my college career as I recently accepted an offer at Mobile Composer to be a Web Developer, this will start after I graduate from the University of St. Thomas this spring. This for me was a great way to finish my senior year, and I am excited to start full-time.
