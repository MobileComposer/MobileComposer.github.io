As I stepped into the world of Web Development. I didn’t know what to expect. I was coming from a background in carpentry/woodworking, so I had no prior experience in the IT field.  I had a lot of questions as I’m sure many entry level/aspiring developers do. 
One question I ask myself frequently is "Do I know enough to get the job done ?" As I’m learning. I understand enough to be considered a Jr. Developer. I don’t need to spend time worrying about that anymore. 
As a recent graduate of the software development program at MCTC (Minneapolis Community & Technical College), and now working in the field.  I’ve learned that I need to have a plan. I need to maintain focus on a path of what I want to do. 

Just recently my boss came to me and asked If I’d like to get Azure certified. I had already made plans in obtaining some form of  .NET certification. However, as I really dug into my new job the thought of getting certified in any form has slipped my mind.  It was in my plans, but not within the year. I initially thought to myself that these things take time. In time I believe I will become a good developer, not quite the stuff of legends, but I do aspire to be up there with the best of them. I am coming to the realization that this doesn’t happen overnight as I code day in and day out. In watching tutorials on pluralsight, sifting through the various questions & answers on stackverflow I find that software/web development will be a continuous and ongoing learning process. You never stop learning in the IT field. Technology is constantly changing.  

Back to the certification. How do you get certified? How do you become proficient enough in one aspect of programming enough to become certified? Surely not within a month. As I’m finding out I already use Azure on a current project that I am working on. Yet, I came into working on an existing project that was already using Azure, so I was already using it all along, what I am essentially doing is diving into the details of how everything works. So yeah, why not get certified it will only help gain a better understanding of the tools that I am working with.    
 
I started with Mobile Composer as an intern. As an intern I quickly had to learn the various technologies and programming languages we would be using with the existing project we were developing. One could say I was thrusted into the web development role… and I liked it. I liked it a lot! It’s fast paced and the possibilities are endless as to what you can create.
 
Well As I begin on my path down to becoming Azure certified I’ll let you know how things turn out in a month in future blog posts. Being that we already use Azure services in our everyday it shouldn’t be too hard to pick up, and with the use of Microsoft Virtual Academy this should be easily obtainable. This has also given me a larger sense of direction in how I was going to go about to get .NET certified is another form. It has also required me to think about a test project in detail. This is also going to help with plans to transition to Angular 2 with our project, as well as familiarizing myself with other new technologies we will be using. 

So, in conclusion, all of you aspiring developers. Recent Grads. Find a path that interests you and stick with it. Develop a plan. Think about how proficient you expect to be within a year. Then ask yourself where do I see myself as a programmer in 2 years? Set some goals and then take the steps to put  your plan into motion. Track your progress. Heck start a blog if you’d like. Share your story as well. Because you never know how your tidbit of information may go onto help and contribute to others in the developer community.
