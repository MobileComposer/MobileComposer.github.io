The initial stages of getting into the programming field was always something that I had heard was a difficult first step. I was struggling with the thought of having to work during the summer, and that job being a dead-end job that had nothing to do with my career of choice. Just when I had begun to worry about what I was going to do, my instructor posted a link to the ScitechSperience program from the Minnesota High Tech Association. I knew that I was going to be looking for an Internship that would allow me to be challenged and allow me to grow as a junior developer. After reading a few of the job postings, I came across the listing by [Mobile Composer](https://www.mcomposer.com/) . The plan for the summer and the technologies that I would be using were so appealing to me and I quickly sent in my application. I heard back within less than 12 hours and had an interview set. 

Once I began the internship the scale of what we would be creating really set in. I was fairly familiar with HTML, CSS and ASP.NET in terms of web development, but when it came to JavaScript I had never worked with this technology. We were set with the task of watching online courses to get us up to speed on the languages we would be writing in. On day one we were set with the task of making our “Summer Playground” project. This was our chance to begin working with some of these new technologies.

Each week we were to prepare a presentation to show our progress on our project. Our weekly tasks were to mimic pieces that would be within the actual Orchestrate project. Throughout the summer, we hit high points, low points and experienced a decent amount of frustration. However, working on the solid team of four that we had overcame and finished our tasks ahead of schedule. Once the summer was over I was offered an opportunity to continue with Mobile Composer, on a part-time basis while I finish my program at Anoka Technical College.

Since starting as a part-time employee for Mobile Composer, I have become the “Analytics Guru” adventuring my way through incorporating data visualizations with D3.js and most recently using the Syncfusion Angular 1 charting library. This has been an amazing learning experience so far, and I greatly look forward to what the future with Mobile Composer holds.
